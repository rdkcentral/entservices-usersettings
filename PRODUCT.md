# UserSettings Plugin - Product Overview

## Product Functionality

The UserSettings plugin provides a unified, persistent user preferences management system for RDK-based devices. It enables applications and services to store, retrieve, and synchronize user-configurable settings across the entire platform, ensuring a consistent user experience regardless of which application or service accesses the settings.

### Core Features

#### Comprehensive Settings Management
The plugin manages a complete spectrum of user preferences across five key categories:

1. **Audio Preferences**
   - Enable/disable audio description for visually impaired users
   - Configure preferred audio language priorities for multi-language content

2. **Caption and Subtitle Control**
   - Toggle closed captions on/off
   - Set preferred caption language priorities
   - Select closed caption service type (CC1-CC4, AUTO)

3. **Parental Controls**
   - PIN-based content access control
   - Age-based viewing restrictions (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, etc.)
   - Time-window restrictions for content access
   - Watershed hour enforcement for live and recorded content
   - Block unrated content
   - Purchase protection with PIN
   - Configurable content PIN codes

4. **Accessibility Features**
   - System presentation language selection
   - High contrast display mode for enhanced visibility
   - Voice guidance for visually impaired navigation
   - Adjustable voice guidance speech rate (0.1x to 10x)
   - Voice guidance hints and prompts

5. **Privacy Settings**
   - Privacy mode configuration for data collection preferences

#### Real-Time Synchronization
- Event-driven notification system ensures all applications receive immediate updates when settings change
- Cross-application consistency: settings modified by one app are instantly reflected in all other apps
- No polling required - efficient push-based notification model

#### Data Persistence
- All settings automatically persist across device reboots
- Leverages the PersistentStore plugin for robust storage
- Default value fallback ensures system always returns valid values

## Use Cases and Target Scenarios

### Set-Top Box (STB) Applications
**Scenario**: A cable/satellite STB serving a multi-user household
- Parents configure parental controls to restrict children's viewing during school hours
- Family members set their preferred audio/caption languages based on individual preferences
- Accessibility settings enable elderly users to navigate with voice guidance
- Settings persist across power cycles and software updates

### Streaming Media Players
**Scenario**: Smart TV or streaming stick used by family members
- Multiple user profiles can be implemented using the UserSettings API
- Consistent caption and audio preferences across all streaming apps
- Centralized privacy settings management for data collection opt-in/opt-out

### Hospitality and Commercial Deployments
**Scenario**: Hotels, hospitals, or assisted living facilities
- Default settings configured for guests/patients during device provisioning
- Accessibility features easily enabled for users with disabilities
- Uniform presentation language across entire facility deployment

### Accessibility-Focused Applications
**Scenario**: Applications designed for users with disabilities
- Voice guidance configuration for blind/low-vision users
- High contrast mode for users with visual impairments
- Audio description support for video content
- Adjustable voice speed accommodates different user needs

### Content Management and Compliance
**Scenario**: Regulatory compliance and content filtering
- Enforce age-appropriate content viewing through parental controls
- Watershed hour compliance for broadcast content
- Audit and reporting capabilities via Inspector interface
- Purchase protection to prevent unauthorized transactions

## API Capabilities

### JSON-RPC API
The plugin exposes a comprehensive JSON-RPC API with methods for:
- **Getters**: Retrieve individual settings or bulk settings via Inspector interface
- **Setters**: Update individual settings with validation
- **Events**: Real-time notifications for all setting changes

### COM-RPC Interfaces
For native service integration:
- `IUserSettings`: Standard user settings interface for get/set operations
- `IUserSettingsInspector`: Bulk query interface for efficient multi-setting retrieval
- `IConfiguration`: Plugin configuration interface

### Integration Benefits
1. **Zero-Configuration Discovery**: Automatic discovery via Thunder framework
2. **Language-Agnostic**: JSON-RPC API accessible from any programming language
3. **Type-Safe Native Interface**: COM-RPC for C++ services requiring type safety
4. **Versioned API**: Semantic versioning ensures backward compatibility
5. **Security**: Optional security token validation for protected operations

## Performance and Reliability

### Performance Characteristics
- **Low Latency**: Settings retrieval typically < 5ms (depends on PersistentStore performance)
- **Minimal Memory Footprint**: Lightweight implementation with no caching overhead
- **Efficient Notifications**: Event-based push model eliminates polling overhead
- **Scalable**: Supports multiple concurrent clients without performance degradation

### Reliability Features
- **Graceful Degradation**: Returns default values if PersistentStore unavailable
- **Thread-Safe**: Mutex-protected operations ensure data consistency in multi-threaded environments
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error codes
- **Validation**: Input parameter validation prevents invalid state persistence
- **Crash Resilience**: Plugin isolation ensures crashes don't affect other Thunder plugins

### Quality Assurance
- **L1 Unit Tests**: Component-level testing with code coverage tracking
- **L2 Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every code change
- **Coverity Static Analysis**: Integrated security and quality scanning
- **Compliance**: Follows RDK coding standards and best practices

## Deployment and Maintenance

### Easy Deployment
- Standard Thunder plugin packaging
- Configurable via JSON configuration file
- Controlled startup order integration
- Auto-start capability for seamless user experience

### Maintainability
- Modular architecture separates API layer from implementation
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and diagnostics
- Version tracking via CHANGELOG.md
- Clear separation of concerns enables independent component updates

### Backward Compatibility
- API versioning strategy maintains compatibility across updates
- Default value mechanism ensures existing clients continue working
- Non-breaking additions via Inspector interface
- Semantic versioning (Current: v2.3.0)

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Unified Settings Store**: Single source of truth for all user preferences across the platform
2. **Real-Time Synchronization**: Immediate cross-application consistency without custom integration
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers audio, video, accessibility, parental controls, and privacy in one plugin
4. **Standards-Based**: Leverages Thunder/WPEFramework industry-standard plugin architecture
5. **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested in commercial RDK deployments worldwide
